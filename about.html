    <h2 class="prod-title">Jerrold Stevens</h2>
    <div class="prod-sub">Founder | AV &amp; Acoustics Systems Design</div>

    <div class="small" style="margin-top:10px;">
      Jerrold Stevens is the founder of BIM Acoustics and has spent decades working at the intersection of
      audio-video system design, acoustics, and professional education.
    </div>

    <div class="small" style="margin-top:10px;">
      His background spans consulting practice, system design, and teaching, with a long-standing focus on
      sound reinforcement and distributed audio systems. Jerrold has taught and developed courses for industry
      organizations including InfoComm / AVIXA and has presented internationally across North America,
      Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.
    </div>

    <div class="small" style="margin-top:10px;">
      In recent years, his work has centered on applying BIM methodologies to AV design—specifically using
      Revit to improve consistency, coordination, and efficiency in multi-room projects. BIM Acoustics tools
      are built directly from this experience, reflecting workflows used in practice rather than abstract
      theory.
